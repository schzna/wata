                    Abstract. Can you guarantee secrecy even if an adversary can
                    eavesdrop on your brain? We consider the problem of
                    protecting privacy in circuits, when faced with an adversary
                    that can access a bounded number of wires in the circuit.
                    This question is motivated by side channel attacks, which
                    allow an adversary to gain partial access to the inner
                    workings of hardware. Recent work has shown that side
                    channel attacks pose a serious threat to cryptosystems
                    implemented in embedded devices. In this paper, we develop
                    theoretical foundations for security against side channels.
                    In particular, we propose several efficient techniques for
                    building private circuits resisting this type of attacks. We
                    initiate a systematic study of the complexity of such
                    private circuits, and in contrast to most prior work in this
                    area provide a formal threat model and give proofs of
                    security for our constructions.
